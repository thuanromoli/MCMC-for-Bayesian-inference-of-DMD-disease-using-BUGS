<h1>Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference of Duchene
Muscular Dystrophy disease using BUGS and NIMBLE</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Real statistical problems are typically characterised by a high number of unknown parameters to be estimated, resulting in high dimensional posterior distributions of complex and often of non-standard form. This was essentially the reason why the classical approach dominated statistics until the 1990s. Bayesian statistics were fine in theory, but intractable in practice. However, the increase in computational power, coupled with computational algorithms introduced to the statistical literature has made Bayesian analyses feasible (and often easier than alternative classical approaches!). In this project we use the computer language BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling). BUGS is implemented in the free package Nimble, a R statistical package that allows users to fit complex statistical models using the BUGS language.


This project has three aims: (1) explore the theory that allows high dimensional, complex, and intractable posteriors to be calculated; (2) give an introduction to the BUGS language; and (3) carry out Bayesian inference of Duchene Muscular Dystrophy disease using BUGS.
